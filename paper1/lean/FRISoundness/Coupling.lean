/-! ## Half-threshold proximity-gap helper

A direct restatement of `ca_halved` over an arbitrary linear submodule
`C' ⊆ (L' → F)`. The paper's `thm:proximity-gap` adds two ingredients on
top of this helper:

1. The FRI coupling step (Δ(f, RS_k) > δ ⟹ joint Δ((fE, fO), RS_{k/2}²) > δ),
   formalized at the abstract level as `RSCode.coupling_pointwise` and
   `RSCode.coupling_counting`. Wiring those into a paper-faithful theorem
   requires an instantiated `RSIsomorphismWitness` for the concrete
   multiplicative-coset FRI domain (not yet in the library).
2. The above-Johnson distance hypothesis under which BCIKS supplies the
   round-≥-2 bound. The library does not yet include a faithful
   transcription of BCIKS '20 Theorem 1.2; see STATUS.md for the
   roadmap entry that fills this in.

Until those two pieces are in place we expose the helper below under the
name `proximity_gap_core` so a reader does not mistake it for the full
paper-labelled theorem. -/

**Half-threshold proximity-gap helper** (alias for `ca_halved` on a
folded linear code).

If the joint distance of `(fE, fO)` from `C' × C'` exceeds `2d`, then at
most one `α ∈ F` makes `fE + α · fO` agree with a codeword of `C'` on
`≥ |L'| - d` positions. -/

/-! ## Schwartz–Zippel root count

Used by the paper's Strategy A (honest fold) commit-phase analysis.
The multivariate / multilinear reduction needed for the full Strategy A is
not in scope for this lemma; this theorem provides the univariate
root-count step. -/

`natDegree` distinct roots. Proved from Mathlib's `Polynomial.card_roots`

/-! ## Roadmap note: full paper-labelled FRI soundness theorem

The paper's full FRI-soundness theorem (`thm:fri-full`) bounds
`Pr[FRI accepts] ≤ nR/|F| + (1 - δ/2)^q`. The two combinatorial
components are:
- Round 1 contributes ≤ 1 bad scalar via `ca_halved`.
- Rounds 2..R contribute ≤ |L| bad scalars each, supplied externally by
  BCIKS '20 Theorem 1.2 (zero-loss proximity gap below the Johnson
  bound). A faithful transcription of that theorem against the FRI
  pairing data is not yet in this library.

The probabilistic step is a per-round union bound:
`Σᵢ |bad_i| / |F| ≤ (1 + (R-1)·n) / |F| ≤ nR / |F|`
(NOT a tuple count over `F^R`; see `bad_alpha_count`).

The rational form of the bound is proved in `Probability.lean`
(`fri_soundness_above_johnson_counting`,
`fri_soundness_above_johnson_probability`); converting the rational
inequality to the paper-form probability statement requires a concrete
FRI transcript instantiation. STATUS.md lists this as the priority-1
roadmap item. -/
