# Paper 1 Lean 4 formalization — status board

This is the per-theorem formalization status of Paper 1
("FRI Soundness Above the Johnson Bound via Threshold Halving",
ePrint [2026/861](https://eprint.iacr.org/2026/861)).

**Build status (latest CI run):** see badge in repo root README.
The Lean library currently uses `lean-toolchain = leanprover/lean4:v4.13.0` and Mathlib pinned in `lake-manifest.json`.

## Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|------:|
| `sorry` count (excluding docstring mentions) | **0** |
| `axiom` count | **1** |
| Top-level theorems / lemmas | **23** |
| Paper theorems with a Lean counterpart | **7 / ~22 soundness-relevant** |

The single axiom is `Coupling.bciks_proximity_gap`, the **external BCIKS** proximity gap result (Theorem 1.6 of BCIKS '20). It is a published, peer-reviewed result; we treat it as a black-box dependency.

## What "ZERO-SORRY" means precisely

For each ✅ entry: every proof in the corresponding Lean file closes via standard Mathlib lemmas, with **no `sorry` tactic and no `admit`**. Outside Mathlib's standard axioms (classical logic, choice, propext), the only project-level axiom referenced anywhere in the library is `bciks_proximity_gap`, and we mark every transitive consumer with the 🟦 label.

## What "🟨 COUNTING-FORM" means for `thm:fri-full`

`fri_soundness_above_johnson_probability` proves the rational inequality

```
badChallenges/|F|  +  (missing^q)/(n^q)
  ≤ (n·R)/|F|     +  ((n−d)^q)/(n^q)
```

over uniformly sampled finite transcript spaces. The paper's
`(1 − δ/2)^q` form is recovered by setting `d = ⌈δn/2⌉` so that
`(n−d)/n ≤ 1 − δ/2`. The remaining gap to a paper-form theorem is the
**event instantiation**: tying the abstract `event : Ω → Prop` of
`UniformTranscriptModel` to the concrete acceptance predicate of an
interactive (or Fiat-Shamir transformed) FRI run. We chose to keep this
abstract because the protocol-event encoding is the standard part — the
proximity-gap content is the contribution.

## Roadmap

In priority order for further Lean work (matches the order the user has
chosen for the next session):

1. **`thm:fri-full` — close the protocol-event gap**: instantiate
   `UniformTranscriptModel.event` with the FRI verifier acceptance
   predicate and propagate the rational bound. This converts 🟨 → ✅.
2. **`thm:eq-threshold-upper` lower-bound matching** (`prop:eq-threshold-tight`):
   the construction is explicit in the paper; re-encoding it in Lean
   gives a tightness statement.
3. **`thm:proximity-gap-char2` packaging**: `gen_coupling_*` is already
   formalized; package `gen_coupling_counting + ca_halved` as one
   theorem matching the paper's labelled statement.
4. **`thm:stir-full`**: port STIR Lemmas 4.4 / 4.5 and combine with
   `batch_ca_aggregate`.
5. **Circle FRI chain**: `lem:circle-iso → lem:circle-coupling →
   thm:circle-pg → thm:fri-circle`. The skeleton mirrors the
   multiplicative case; new piece is the `i^2 + j^2 = 1` circle
   parametrization in Mathlib.
6. **RBR / non-interactive / DEEP-FRI**: depends on a Fiat-Shamir
   formalization layer in Mathlib (currently absent).

## Notes for reviewers

- The single non-Mathlib axiom in the library is `bciks_proximity_gap`,
  located at `Coupling.lean:95`. It directly transcribes BCIKS '20
  Theorem 1.6 (zero-loss proximity gap below the Johnson bound) and is
  the **only** place where an external proven result is taken on faith.
- The paper's Theorem 1 (`thm:ca-halved`) is RVW13's classical 1:2
  inequality; we acknowledge this in §3. The Lean formalization gives
  a self-contained, machine-checkable proof within Mathlib (no external
  axiom).
- Theorem `thm:eq-threshold-upper` (the `\binom{n}{w}/|F|` upper bound)
  is, to our knowledge, **new in this paper**. Its Lean formalization
  closes via an injection into `Finset.powersetCard`.
- `thm:whir-full` is **stated as a conjecture in the paper** (the
  iteration-level induction with our substituted folding term is left
  for follow-up work). The MCA-orthogonality content needed for the
  proximity-layer term-substitution is rigorously stated as
  `lem:whir-mca-orthogonality` in the paper; a Lean version is on the
  TODO list above.
